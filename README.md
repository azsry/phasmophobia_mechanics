# Phasmophobia Mechanics

Phasmophobia Mechanics documents the inner workings of how the Game Phasmophobia
works by analyzing the actual code of the game. Not by using any other information.
If you're expecting the guide on this page, note the information has moved to a style
where per-version information is being kept in folders so it is clear when something
may be out of date, and also when specific changes occured.
